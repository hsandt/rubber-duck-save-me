# Rubber Duck, Save Me!

A kind of escape room made with Ren'Py, originally for [Taku's Mini Jam](https://itch.io/jam/takus-mini-jam) in May 2019 on the theme "Rubber Duck" (chosen among three). The game was not finished in time though, so I decided to submit it for the [Finally Finish Something 2020](https://itch.io/jam/finally-finish-something-2020) instead.
