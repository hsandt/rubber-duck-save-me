# Rubber Duck, Save Me!

A kind of escape room made with Ren'Py, originally for [Taku's Mini Jam](https://itch.io/jam/takus-mini-jam) on the theme "Rubber Duck" (chosen among three), then (about to be) submitted to the [Finally Finish Something 2020](https://itch.io/jam/finally-finish-something-2020).

Taku's Mini Jam ran from May 24, 2019 to May 28, but the game was far from finished, so I decided not to submit it and continue working on it over the year. Then I found about the FFS jam and found it was a good opportunity to submit it for real this time.
